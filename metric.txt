We devised our own metric to evaluate the goodness and accuracy of the itineraries generated. We compared the tours generated to the top places generated by well known travel websited like Make My Trip and Travel Traingle. We found that they were almost similar. We also calculated the tour interest score by computing the percentage difference in the cost of the tour generated and the budget. Thus, we were able to rank the tours and presented the top 3 tours to the user.

We devised a custom metric to evaluate the accuracy and quality of the itineraries generated by our system. To ensure our tours were comparable to established standards, we compared them against the top destinations recommended by well-known travel websites such as Make My Trip and Travel Triangle. Our analysis revealed that the itineraries we generated were almost identical to those suggested by these popular platforms.

In addition to this qualitative comparison, we introduced a quantitative measure called the Tour Interest Score. This score was calculated by determining the percentage difference between the user's budget and he cost of the generated tour. Using this metric, we were able to rank the itineraries effectively.

Ultimately, we presented the top three itineraries to the user based on their Tour Interest Scores, ensuring a balanced consideration of both cost and destination popularity.
