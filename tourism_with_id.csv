For example, the shape of the building in front of the Tasikmalaya Railway Station. Starting construction in 1920, this white building still stands strong but elegant and now functions as the central government building for West Java. eldest Mayor of Bandung, Bertus Coops and Petronella Roelofsen, representing the Governor General in Batavia, JP Graaf van Limburg Stirum on July 27, 1920, was the result of the planning of a team consisting of Ir.J.Gerber, a well-known young architect who graduated from the Delft Nederland Faculty of Engineering , Ir. Er. De Roo and Ir. G. Hendriks and the Gemeente van Bandoeng, chaired by Col. pur. VL. Slors involved 2,000 workers, 150 of whom were carvers, or bongpay experts, carvers of tombstones and woodcarvers of Chinese nationality who came from Confucian or Cantonese origin, assisted by stone masons, stir workers and servers from residents of Sekeloa Village, Coblong Dago Village, Kampung Gandok and Cibarengkok Village, which previously they worked on Gedong Sirap (ITB Campus) and Gedong Papak (Bandung City Hall). Post, Telephone and Telegraph) and Libraries. The architecture of Gedung Sate is the work of architect Ir. J.Gerber and his group cannot be separated from the input of the Dutch architect maestro Dr. Hendrik Petrus Berlage, who has the nuances of the face of traditional Indonesian architecture. Indo-European architecture, (Indo Europeeschen architectuur stijl), so it is not impossible that the elegance of the Borobudur Temple will also color Gedung Sate. Some opinions about the splendor of Gedung Sate include Cor Pashier and Jan Wittenberg, two Dutch architects, who said ""the architectural style of Gedung Sate is the experimental style of the architect which leads to the form of Indo-European architectural styles"".\nD. Ruhl in his book Bandoeng en haar Hoogvlakte 1952, ""Gedung Sate is the most beautiful building in Indonesia"". HP Berlage, during a visit to Gedung Sate April 1923, stated, ""Gedung Sate is a major architectural work, which successfully combines eastern and western styles in harmony"". As with the Italian architectural style during the renaissance, especially in the west wing building. Meanwhile, the terraced tower in the middle of the building looks like a meru or pagoda roof. There are many more opinions of Indonesian architects who state the splendor of Gedung Sate, for example Slamet Wirasonjaya, and Ir. Harnyoto Kunto. \nThe strength and integrity of Gedung Sate to this day cannot be separated from the materials and construction techniques used. The walls of Gedung Sate are made of large stone chips (1 ? 1 ? 2 m) taken from the rocky hills in eastern Bandung around Arcamanik and Mount Manglayang. The construction of the Gedung Sate building uses a professional conventional method with due observance of technical standards. I 212,976 m?ý, Second floor 3,023,796 m?ý, second floor terrace 212,976 m?ý, tower 121 m?ý and tower terrace 205,169 m?ý. \nGerber himself combines several architectural styles into his design. For the windows, Gerber takes the Spanish Moorish theme, while the building is Italian Renaissance. Especially for the tower, Gerber incorporates Asian flow, namely the roof style of Balinese temples or pagodas in Thailand. At the top there is a ""skewer"" with 6 skewer ornaments (another version says water guava or jasmine), which represents 6 million guilders - the amount used to build Gedung Sate. Ornaments made of stone, located above the main door of Gedung Sate, are often associated with the Borobudur temple because of their similar shape. The facade (front view) of Gedung Sate turns out to be very calculated. By following the north-south axis (which is also applied to Pakuan Building, which faces Mount Malabar in the south), Gedung Sate was deliberately built to face Mount Tangkuban Perahu in the north. the center of government of the Dutch East Indies after Batavia was deemed no longer eligible as a center of government because of its development, so it was used by the Bureau of Public Works. On December 3, 1945, an incident occurred that killed seven youths who defended Gedung Sate from attacks by Gurkha troops. To commemorate the seven youths, a stone monument was made which was placed behind the Gedung Sate courtyard. By order of the Minister of Public Works on December 3, 1970 the monument was moved to the forecourt of Gedung Sate. Since 1980, Gedung Sate has been known as the Governor's Office because it was the center of activities for the West Java Provincial Government, which previously occupied the Kerta Mukti Building in Jalan Braga Bandung. The Governor's office is on the second floor along with the offices of the Deputy Governor, Regional Secretary, Assistants and Bureau.

This room is more commonly known as the west hall and east hall, often used for official activities. Around these two halls there are rooms occupied by several Bureaus with their staff. At the top there is a floor called Menara Gedung Sate, this floor cannot be seen from below, to go to the top floor using the elevator or by climbing a wooden ladder. The magnificent perfection of Gedung Sate is complemented by the New Building which takes a bit of the architectural style of Gedung Sate but with a contextual style created by architect Ir. Sudibyo which was built in 1977 for the Leaders and Members of the Regional Representatives Council of West Java Province in carrying out their duties and functions as a Legislative Body Region.\nGedung Sate has become one of the tourist destinations in the city of Bandung. Particularly for foreign tourists, many of them deliberately visit because they have emotional and historical ties to this building. This connection between emotion and history might be felt more fully if you climb the available steps one by one to the Gedung Sate tower. There are 6 stairs that must be traversed with 10 steps each that must be climbed. The beauty of this park is often used as a location for activities that have a family feel, a location for shooting music video clips for both local and national artists, a location for family photos or self-portraits and even photos of the wedding couple. relax, just sit around enjoying the fresh air of the city of Bandung or do some light exercise. Comparing Gedung Sate with the central government buildings (capitol buildings) in many national capitals doesn't seem like an exaggeration. The similarities are all built in the middle of a green complex with a magnificent central tower.
